"""
CLI demo that browses the playlist tree and gets track metadata for the
chosen playlist.

Install lexicon-python before running demo::

    pip install lexicon-python

Optionally set ``LEXICON_HOST`` / ``LEXICON_PORT`` environment variables or 
edit the LexiconClient initialization in the code if your Lexicon instance 
is not available at the defaults (``localhost:48624``).
